CHART PATTERNS MASTERCLASS — PODCAST SCRIPT
=============================================

[PART 1: INTRO & FOUNDATIONS]

Welcome back to The Trading Edge — the podcast where we break down the strategies that separate profitable traders from everyone else. I'm your host, and today... we're going deep. We're covering the complete playbook for chart patterns and technical analysis. If you've ever looked at a stock chart and thought, "I have no idea what I'm looking at" — this episode is for you. And even if you're experienced, stick around, because we're covering some advanced stuff: the VCP, CANSLIM, Minervini's trend template — the whole nine yards. Let's get into it.

So — let's start with the absolute basics. Every stock chart tells you one story: the battle between buyers and sellers. When buyers are aggressive, prices go up. When sellers take over, prices fall. That's it. Technical analysis is simply learning to read that battle.

The most common way to visualize this is with candlestick charts. Each candle represents one trading day. A green candle means the stock closed higher than it opened — bullish. A red candle means it closed lower — bearish. The thick part is called the body, that's your open-to-close range. And those thin lines sticking out? Those are the wicks — they show you the high and the low for the day. Already, just from one candle, you can read a lot about what happened. A long lower wick, for example — that's a hammer — it tells you sellers pushed the price down hard, but buyers fought back and reclaimed most of the ground. That's a potential reversal signal.

Now, volume. I cannot stress this enough — volume is the single most important confirming indicator in technical analysis. Think of price as the story, and volume as the conviction behind it. A breakout on heavy volume? That's real. Institutions are committing capital. A breakout on thin volume? That's suspicious — it could reverse at any moment. Always, always check the volume.

Next up: support and resistance. Support is like a floor — a price level where buyers consistently step in. Resistance is the ceiling — where sellers push back. Here's a key insight that a lot of beginners miss: when support breaks, it becomes resistance. And when resistance breaks, it becomes support. These levels flip. Keep that in mind.

And finally, moving averages. The fifty-day moving average is the institutional line in the sand — big funds watch it religiously. The two hundred-day moving average tells you the long-term trend. When the fifty crosses above the two hundred? That's called a Golden Cross — bullish. When it crosses below? Death Cross — bearish. These are simple, but powerful.

[PART 2: THE BIG FOUR PATTERNS]

Alright, now let's get to the good stuff — the base patterns. A base is a consolidation period where a stock digests a prior advance. Think of it as the launchpad. Institutions quietly accumulate shares during bases, and when the base is complete — boom — the next leg up begins.

First, the Cup and Handle. This is William O'Neil's signature pattern, and it's arguably the most reliable pattern in all of technical analysis. Picture a coffee cup — literally. The stock pulls back, forms a rounded bottom — that's the cup. Then it drifts slightly lower on the right side — that's the handle. The cup is typically twelve to thirty-five percent deep, and it forms over seven to sixty-five weeks. The handle? Just a week or two, drifting down on light volume. That handle drift is critical — it shakes out the weak hands. Your buy point is the top of the handle plus ten cents. And on the breakout day, you want volume at least forty to fifty percent above average. That confirms institutions are driving the move.

Second — the Volatility Contraction Pattern, or VCP, popularized by Mark Minervini, a U.S. Investing Champion. This one is beautiful in its logic. Imagine a spring being compressed. The stock pulls back — say twenty-five percent. Then it bounces and pulls back again — but only fifteen percent this time. Then again — just eight percent. Each contraction is tighter than the last. What's happening? Sellers are exhausting themselves. Each wave of selling is weaker. Volume dries up — sometimes to thirty or forty percent of normal. And then, when the last seller is gone — snap — the stock explodes out of the pivot. You want at least two to three contractions, each one tighter, with clear volume dry-up. The buy point is the top of that final, tightest contraction.

Third — the Flat Base. This one screams strength. After a stock breaks out and advances twenty to twenty-five percent, instead of pulling back hard, it just... moves sideways. Barely corrects — maybe ten to fifteen percent over at least five weeks. That's a flat base. It tells you nobody wants to sell this stock. The buy point is the high of the flat base plus ten cents. When you see a flat base form after a prior breakout, pay attention — that stock has serious institutional backing.

And fourth — the Double Bottom. This looks like the letter W on the chart. Two distinct lows with a peak in the middle. Here's the secret sauce: the second low should slightly undercut the first low. Why? Because that undercut triggers stop-loss orders and scares out weak holders — it's the final shakeout. After that flush, buyers step in aggressively. Your buy point is the middle peak — the top of the W — plus ten cents. Volume should dry up at that second low and then surge on the breakout.

[PART 3: CANSLIM, SEPA & PRACTICAL RULES]

Now let's zoom out from chart patterns and talk about stock selection. Because the best pattern in the world won't save you if the underlying company is garbage.

Enter CANSLIM — William O'Neil's legendary growth stock methodology. Each letter is a criterion. C stands for Current quarterly earnings — you want twenty-five percent growth or more, year over year. A is Annual earnings — again, twenty-five percent plus for at least three to five years. N is for New — new products, new management, something driving growth. S is Supply and demand — smaller float stocks move more explosively. L is Leader — buy the number one or two stock in the strongest industry groups, with a Relative Strength rating of eighty or above. I is Institutional sponsorship — rising ownership by quality mutual funds and hedge funds. And M is Market direction — because three out of four stocks follow the general market. Don't fight the market.

Now, Mark Minervini takes this even further with his SEPA criteria — Specific Entry Point Analysis. Before he even looks at a pattern, the stock must pass his Trend Template. And here it is: The stock price must be above both the one-fifty and two-hundred-day moving averages. The one-fifty-day must be above the two hundred. The two-hundred-day must be trending up for at least a month. The fifty-day must be above both. The current price should be at least thirty percent above the fifty-two-week low, and within twenty-five percent of the fifty-two-week high. And the Relative Strength rating should be seventy or higher. If a stock doesn't pass this template? Move on. There are thousands of stocks — only trade the ones in a confirmed Stage Two uptrend.

And that brings us to the single most important topic in trading — risk management. Here's a number that should scare you: a fifty percent loss requires a one hundred percent gain just to break even. You have to double your money just to get back to where you started. That's why Minervini's rule is absolute: cut losses at seven to eight percent, maximum. No exceptions. Position sizing matters too — risk no more than one to two percent of your total portfolio on any single trade. Calculate your position size by dividing your risk amount by your stop-loss distance. If you're willing to risk a thousand dollars and your stop is five dollars below entry, you buy two hundred shares. Simple math, but it keeps you in the game.

Let me leave you with this: the best traders aren't right more often — they just lose small and win big. They let their winners run and cut their losers fast. They trade with the trend, buy at proper pivot points, and always — always — respect the volume.

Alright, that's a wrap on this episode of The Trading Edge. We covered candlesticks, volume, support and resistance, moving averages, the Cup and Handle, the VCP, Flat Bases, Double Bottoms, CANSLIM, the Minervini Trend Template, and risk management. If you got value from this, share it with a fellow trader. And remember — the trend is your friend, until it bends at the end. I'll catch you on the next one. Trade well.
