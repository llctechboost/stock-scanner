# PATTERN 1: CUP WITH HANDLE

## Definition

A U-shaped base lasting 7-65 weeks. Price drops, rounds out a bottom, recovers to the prior high, then pulls back slightly (the "handle") before breaking out. The most common and reliable CANSLIM pattern.

## Why It Works

The cup shakes out weak holders. The rounded bottom = transition from selling to buying. The handle = final shakeout — last weak hands exit. Only strong institutions remain.

## Rules

| Parameter | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Cup depth | 12-33% from high to low |
| Cup shape | U-shaped (NOT V-shaped) |
| Cup duration | 7-65 weeks |
| Handle depth | Max 12% pullback |
| Handle duration | 1-4 weeks |
| Handle direction | Drifts DOWN (not up) |
| Handle position | Must be in upper half of cup |
| Breakout volume | 50%+ above average |

## What to Look For

✅ **U-shaped bottom** (gradual rounding, not sharp V)
✅ **Volume dries up** at the cup bottom (sellers exhausted)
✅ **Volume picks up** on right side (buyers returning)
✅ **Handle drifts down** on declining volume (final shakeout)
✅ **Multiple weeks** of handle formation (longer coil = bigger move)

❌ **V-shaped bottom** = panic selling, not orderly accumulation
❌ **Handle in lower half** = pattern failing, institutions not supporting
❌ **Handle drifts UP** (ascending wedge) = supply increasing, bearish
❌ **Breakout on low volume** = fake, likely to fail

## Common Mistakes

- Buying BEFORE the breakout (base hasn't finished)
- Buying breakouts on LOW volume (fake breakouts)
- Not recognizing V-bottoms vs U-bottoms (V = worse odds)

### 📸 EXAMPLE 1: NFLX Weekly — Cup with Handle (Grade: B+)
**Chart file:** `NFLX_weekly_example.jpg`

**What the AI Vision sees:**

**Date Range:** October 2023 → June 2024 (~8 months)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Left lip | ~$52-54 (Oct 2023 high) |
| Cup low | ~$40-42 (Dec 2023-Jan 2024 trough) |
| Right lip | ~$52-54 (March-April 2024) |
| Handle range | ~$48-54 (May-June 2024, drifting down) |
| Pivot/Buy Point | ~$54 |
| Cup depth | ~20-23% ✅ (within 12-33%) |

**Visual Breakdown:**
Starting from a peak ~$52-54 in late 2023, NFLX rounds down into the low $40s forming a U-shaped cup bottom. It climbs back to the prior high area by spring 2024 (right side). A small downward drift in the $48-54 zone forms the handle — textbook mild drift down. The breakout above $54 launches the next major move to $70+, then $90+, eventually $130+.

**Why B+ not A:** Base formed relatively quickly (~7 months, shorter side). Volume patterns in handle not perfectly dry. But the U-shape and handle drift are textbook.

**Outcome:** NFLX broke out at ~$54 and ran to $130+ — a **140% gain** from the pivot. Monster move.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE 2: META Daily — Cup with Handle (Grade: B+)
**Chart file:** `META_daily_example.jpg`

**What the AI Vision sees:**

**Date Range:** September 2025 → January 2026 (~5 months)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Left lip | ~$720-730 (Sep 2025) |
| Cup low | ~$595-605 (Oct-Nov 2025) |
| Right lip | ~$720-740 (Jan 2026) |
| Handle | Forming now (~$740 → $716) |
| Pivot/Buy Point | ~$740-745 |
| Cup depth | ~17-18% ✅ |

**Visual Breakdown:**
META sold off sharply from $720-730 in September through October. Carved a U-shaped bottom in the $600-650 range for ~5-6 weeks (November), with progressively higher lows — the classic rounded cup bottom. Right side rallied from December through January back to $720-740. Current pullback from $740 to $716 forming the handle (~3-4% depth — very shallow, constructive).

**Why B+ not A:** Left side dropped faster than right side recovered (slight asymmetry). 18% depth on deeper side but acceptable.

**Current Status:** Handle forming. Watch for breakout above $740-745 on volume.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE 3: CELH Daily — Cup with Handle (Grade: B+)
**Chart file:** `CELH_daily_example.jpg`

**Date Range:** Mid-July → Late October 2025 (~10 weeks)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Left lip | ~$60 (July peak) |
| Cup low | ~$51-52 (Sep trough) |
| Right lip | ~$64-65 (Oct peak) |
| Handle low | ~$57 (late Oct) |
| Pivot/Buy Point | ~$65 |
| Cup depth | ~22% |

**Visual Breakdown:**
CELH declined from $60 in July, rounded through August to a $51-54 bottom in September. Right side rallied back to $64-65 by October. Handle formed with pullback to $57 on lighter volume. The U-shaped bottom is clean — not V-shaped.

**Why B+ not A:** Handle shook out slightly deeper than ideal (~13% vs <12% rule). Cup depth at 22% is on the deeper side.

# PATTERN 2: FLAT BASE ⭐ (Best Win Rate: 46.7%)

## Definition

Stock trades sideways in a tight range (<15%) for 5+ weeks after a prior uptrend. A "resting" stock catching its breath before the next leg up.

## Why It Works

Institutions quietly accumulate shares without pushing price up. Retail traders get bored and sell. Smart money absorbs every share. Tighter range = more controlled buying.

## Rules

| Parameter | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Range | < 15% from high to low |
| Duration | 5+ weeks (6-7 preferred) |
| Prior uptrend | At least 20% advance before base |
| Volume | Should decline during base |
| Breakout volume | 50%+ above average |

## What to Look For

✅ **Narrow rectangular band** — price bouncing between tight support/resistance
✅ **Small-bodied candles** — low volatility, overlapping
✅ **Shrinking volume bars** — sellers drying up
✅ **Multiple tests of the top** before breakout = building pressure

❌ Range > 15% = not a flat base
❌ Duration < 5 weeks = too early
❌ Volume increasing during base = institutions selling

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE: NFLX Weekly — Flat Base (Grade: A-)
**Chart file:** `NFLX_weekly_example.jpg`

**Date Range:** July 2024 → October 2024 (~12 weeks)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Ceiling | ~$77-80 |
| Floor | ~$68-70 |
| Range | ~12-14% ✅ (under 15%) |
| Pivot/Buy Point | ~$80 |

**Visual Breakdown:**
After NFLX's powerful cup-with-handle breakout and run to ~$80, the stock paused and consolidated in a tight sideways channel between $68-80 for about 12 weeks. This is a textbook flat base:

- **Tight rectangular range** clearly visible on the weekly chart
- **Volume declined** during the base — sellers drying up
- **Price tested the ~$80 ceiling** multiple times before breaking through
- **Duration:** 12 weeks — well above the 5-week minimum

**Why A- not A:** Range at 14% is close to the 15% limit. A true A-grade flat base would be 8-10% range. But the duration (12 weeks) and volume characteristics are textbook.

**Outcome:** NFLX broke above $80 and ran to $130+ — a **62% gain** from the pivot.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE: GOOGL Daily — Flat Base (Grade: B+)
**Chart file:** `GOOGL_20260131_2227.png`

**Date Range:** January 2026 (~5 weeks)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Ceiling | ~$342.97 |
| Floor | ~$310 |
| Range | 9.3% ✅ |
| Pivot/Buy Point | $342.97 |
| Duration | 5 weeks ✅ |

**Visual Breakdown:**
After a powerful advance from October lows (~$220) to ~$340 by late December, GOOGL entered a flat consolidation. Price oscillated between $310-343 for 5 weeks. Volume clearly contracted during the base — bars got progressively shorter. The 21-day MA at $328 acts as dynamic support within the base.

**Why B+ not A:** Duration at exactly 5 weeks is the minimum. Range is good (9.3%) but some choppiness rather than perfectly smooth horizontal action.

**⚠️ Status:** Earnings Feb 4 — DO NOT ENTER until after. Conviction penalized to 57/100.

# PATTERN 3: HIGH TIGHT FLAG (HTF) — The Rarest Pattern

## Definition

The most explosive and RAREST pattern. Stock rockets 100%+ in 4-8 weeks (the "pole"), then consolidates in a tight flag (<20% pullback, 3-5 weeks). Like a rocket pausing mid-flight.

## Why It Works

Only the absolute strongest momentum stocks can double in 2 months. The tight flag = nobody wants to sell even after a massive run. When it breaks out, it often doubles AGAIN.

## Rules

| Parameter | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Prior advance ("pole") | 100%+ in 4-8 weeks |
| Flag pullback | < 20% from the high |
| Flag duration | 3-5 weeks |
| Volume during flag | Should contract significantly |

## Reality Check

True HTFs happen **2-3 times per YEAR** in the entire market. Most "HTFs" are fake. Our scanner previously detected 45 false positives with a 15% threshold — raised to 40%+ and false positives dropped to zero. Even 40% is relaxed for finding candidates; a true HTF requires 100%+.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE: NVDA Weekly — High Tight Flag (Grade: B)
**Chart file:** `NVDA_weekly_example.jpg`

**Date Range:** Late May 2023 → Late June 2023 (~4-5 weeks)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Pole start | ~$28 (early May 2023) |
| Pole high | ~$48 (late May, post-earnings gap) |
| Pole gain | ~70-80% in 2-3 weeks |
| Flag low | ~$39-40 (mid June) |
| Flag depth | ~17-20% |
| Breakout | ~$48-50 (late June) |

**Visual Breakdown:**
After the massive AI-driven earnings gap in late May 2023, NVDA roughly doubled from $28 to $48 in just 2-3 weeks. It then consolidated in a tight range between $39-48 for about 4 weeks. Volume contracted during the flag. The breakout above $48-50 launched the next leg.

**Why B not A:** The advance was ~70-80% — strong but technically below the 100%+ threshold for a textbook HTF. A true A-grade HTF would show 100%+ in the pole. However, this is the closest real-world example readily available, and the FLAG portion is textbook — tight, low-volume, at the highs.

**Why HTFs are rare:** Looking at the entire NVDA chart from 2023-2026, this is the ONLY period that even remotely qualifies. NVDA went from $15 to $200+ over 2+ years, but the HTF pattern specifically requires the advance to happen in 4-8 weeks, not months. That's why they're so rare.

**Outcome:** NVDA broke above $50 and eventually ran to $140+ over the next year — a **180%+ gain** from the flag breakout.

---

# PATTERN 4: ASCENDING BASE

## Definition

Three or more distinct pullbacks where each LOW is HIGHER than the previous low. Like stair steps walking uphill. It's a base that trends up.

## Why It Works

Each dip gets bought at a progressively higher price = demand accelerating. Institutions are so eager they can't wait for old prices. They bid higher each time.

## Rules

| Parameter | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Pullback count | 3+ distinct pullbacks |
| Each pullback depth | 10-20% |
| Low progression | Each low HIGHER than previous |
| Duration | 3-9 weeks total |
| Volume | Should decline on pullbacks |

## What to Look For

✅ **Ascending trendline** connecting the lows — angles upward
✅ **Pullbacks getting shallower** = sellers exhausting
✅ **Volume drying up** on each pullback
✅ Ascending base + VCP inside = most powerful combination

❌ A pullback that undercuts a previous low = pattern BROKEN
❌ Pullbacks deeper than 20% = too much selling

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE 1: AMD Daily — Ascending Base (Grade: B-)
**Chart file:** `AMD_20260131_2228.png`

**Date Range:** November 2025 → January 2026

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Swing High | ~$255-260 |
| Low #1 | ~$215-220 (mid-Dec) — 15% pullback ✅ |
| Low #2 | ~$225-230 (late Dec/early Jan) — 10% pullback ✅ |
| Low #3 | ~$230+ (mid-Jan) — shallower still ✅ |
| Pivot/Buy Point | $267.49 |

**Visual Breakdown:**
After the cup's right side formed at $255-260, AMD pulled back three times:
- **Low 1 ($215-220):** First pullback — 15% correction
- **Low 2 ($225-230):** Higher than Low 1 ✅ — shallower at 10%
- **Low 3 ($230+):** Higher still ✅ — even shallower

Each step higher shows institutions buying every dip at progressively higher prices. Volume contracted on each pullback.

**Why B- not higher:** Today's -6.13% drop ($236.73) threatens the pattern. If it undercuts the most recent higher low, the ascending base breaks. Also, the handle area is too volatile (not the quiet drift O'Neil wants).

**⚠️ Status:** Earnings Feb 3 — WAIT.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE 2: NU Daily — Ascending Base (Grade: B+)
**Chart file:** `NU_20260131_2228.png`

**Date Range:** September 2025 → January 2026

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| Low #1 | ~$12.50 (Sep) — Cup bottom |
| Low #2 | ~$13.50 (Oct) — Higher ✅ |
| Low #3 | ~$14.80 (Nov) — Higher ✅ |
| Current consolidation | ~$17.50-19.00 |
| Pivot/Buy Point | $19.02 |

**Visual Breakdown:**
NU shows the cleanest ascending base pattern of all our stocks:
- Each low is unambiguously higher than the previous
- Each pullback is shallower than the last
- Volume declines on each successive dip
- The ascending trendline through the lows angles clearly upward

**Why this is special:** The ascending base also has a **VCP** (Volatility Contraction Pattern) inside it — progressively tighter swings (15% → 10% → 7% → 5%). This is the most powerful combination in CANSLIM: ascending base + VCP = maximum coil.

**✅ Status:** No earnings risk. Best setup of our current universe. Watch for $19.02 breakout on volume.

# PATTERN 5: DOUBLE BOTTOM

## Definition

A W-shaped pattern. Price drops, bounces, drops again to near the same level, then bounces again. The "W" shape is the signature.

## Why It Works

The second test of the low proves that level is REAL support. If institutions defend the same price twice, it's a floor. The middle peak of the W = the breakout pivot.

## Rules

| Parameter | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Second low position | At or SLIGHTLY above first low |
| Duration | 7+ weeks total |
| Middle peak | Forms the buy pivot |
| Failed if | Second low significantly BELOW first |
| Breakout volume | 50%+ above average |

## Key Distinction

- Second low AT same level → institutions defending ✅
- Second low ABOVE first → even more demand ✅✅
- Second low BELOW first → support broken ❌ AVOID

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE 1: CELH Daily — Double Bottom (Grade: B)
**Chart file:** `CELH_daily_example.jpg`

**Date Range:** Late August → Late October 2025 (~8 weeks)

| Element | Price Level |
|---|---|
| First Bottom | ~$51-52 (late Aug/early Sep) |
| Middle Peak | ~$57-58 (mid-Sep rally) |
| Second Bottom | ~$51-53 (late Sep/early Oct) |
| Pivot Point | ~$58 (middle peak) |
| Breakout Target | $64+ |

**Visual Breakdown:**
The W-shape is clearly visible:
- **First leg down:** Carves a low near $51 in late August
- **Middle bounce:** Rallies to $57-58 in mid-September (center peak of the W)
- **Second leg down:** Retests $51-53 in late September/early October
- **Second low is AT the first low** = institutions defending that level ✅
- **Recovery:** Breaks above the $58 middle peak, eventually reaching $65+

**Why B not A:** The second low barely held (didn't clearly stay above the first low for a "shakeout undercut" grade-boost). Volume patterns were adequate but not exceptional.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE 2: META Daily — Double Bottom Elements (Grade: B)
**Chart file:** `META_daily_example.jpg`

Within META's broader cup pattern, the bottom shows double-bottom characteristics:
- **First low:** ~$595-600 (late October)
- **Bounce:** ~$650-660 (early November)
- **Second test:** ~$590-605 (late November/early December)
- The second test holds, confirming the $595 area as institutional support

This is a **double bottom within a cup** — the cup has a W-shaped bottom rather than a smooth U. This happens frequently and is still constructive as long as the second low holds.

---

# PATTERN 6: VCP — VOLATILITY CONTRACTION PATTERN ⭐

## Definition

Price swings get progressively TIGHTER over time. Each successive contraction is smaller than the last. Created by Mark Minervini (US Investing Champion).

## Why It Works

Contracting range = sellers drying up. Each swing has fewer sellers. When supply is exhausted, even small buying creates an explosive breakout. Pure supply and demand.

## How to Spot It

1. Draw boxes around each swing within a base
2. Each box should be SMALLER (price range and time)
3. Volume shrinks with each contraction
4. Final contraction is very tight (2-3%)
5. Buy on breakout from the final tight range

## Example Contraction Sequence

```
Swing 1: 15% range ──────────────
Swing 2: 10% range ────────
Swing 3:  7% range ──────
Swing 4:  3% range ───  ← BUY HERE on breakout
```

## Why AI Vision Matters for VCPs

Our math scanner can't detect VCPs — the contractions are too nuanced for simple algorithms. But AI vision sees the progressively tighter swings in the actual chart image. This is where AI adds the most value.

---

### 📸 EXAMPLE: NU Daily — VCP Inside Ascending Base (Grade: B+)
**Chart file:** `NU_20260131_2228.png`

**Contraction Sequence:**

| Swing | Range | Period |
|---|---|---|
| Swing 1 | ~15% | September pullback |
| Swing 2 | ~10% | October pullback |
| Swing 3 | ~7% | November pullback |
| Swing 4 | ~5% | January handle/consolidation |

**Visual Breakdown:**
Within NU's ascending base, each successive swing gets tighter. The September pullback was ~15%, October ~10%, November ~7%, and the current January consolidation is just ~5%. Volume declined with each contraction.

**This is the textbook VCP:**
- Each box is smaller than the last ✅
- Volume contracts progressively ✅
- Final contraction is tight (~5%) ✅
- Occurs within an ascending base (maximum power) ✅

**Why this is the best pattern combination:** VCP inside ascending base inside cup with handle. It's a triple-layered coil. When it breaks, it should move decisively.

---

# PATTERN 7: POCKET PIVOT

## Definition

An early-entry signal BEFORE a traditional breakout. Price moves up through the 10-day MA on volume greater than any DOWN day volume in the prior 10 sessions.

## Why It Works

You're detecting institutional buying footprints before the crowd notices. Gets you in at a lower price with a tighter stop — but higher failure rate since you're entering before full confirmation.

## Rules

| Parameter | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Price close | Must be above the 10-day MA |
| Volume | Must exceed highest DOWN day volume in prior 10 sessions |
| Context | Within a base or after pullback to 10-day MA |
| Trend | Overall uptrend required |

## Best Used For

- Adding to existing winning positions
- Entering new positions in strongly confirmed uptrends
- Getting a lower cost basis before the "official" breakout

## Why No Chart Example

Pocket pivots are single-day events that require comparing volume to specific prior sessions — they're hard to identify from a static chart image without volume annotations. They're detected by our math scanner algorithmically, not visually. When our scanner flags a pocket pivot, it compares today's volume to each of the prior 10 down-day volumes automatically.

---

# PATTERN 8: BASE ON BASE

## Definition

A new base forms on top of a previous base. The stock breaks out from one base, advances 20%+, then forms another base at the higher level.

## Why It Works

Each base is a new accumulation phase. When a stock forms multiple bases stacked on top of each other, it means institutions keep buying at progressively higher prices across multiple accumulation cycles.

## Rules

- First base must have a valid breakout
- Stock must advance 20%+ from the first base's pivot
- Second base forms at the higher price level
- Second base follows all normal base rules

### 📸 EXAMPLE: NFLX Weekly — Base on Base (Grade: A-)
**Chart file:** `NFLX_weekly_example.jpg`

**Visual Breakdown:**
The NFLX weekly chart shows one of the clearest base-on-base progressions in recent markets:

1. **Base 1: Cup with Handle** (Oct 2023 → June 2024)
   - Pivot: ~$54
   - Breakout runs to ~$80 (+48%)

2. **Base 2: Flat Base** (July 2024 → Oct 2024)
   - Forms at $68-80 (on top of Base 1)
   - Pivot: ~$80
   - Breakout runs to ~$95 (+19%)

3. **Base 3: Another consolidation** (Late 2024 → Early 2025)
   - Forms at $90-100 area
   - Breakout launches to $130+ (+30%+)

**Each base sits on top of the previous one** like floors of a building. The stock stair-steps higher through multiple accumulation phases. Institutions keep adding at higher and higher prices.

**Why A- not A:** Some of the intermediate bases are slightly choppy. But the overall stacking pattern is textbook.

**Total move:** From $42 (cup bottom) to $130+ = **210%+ gain** through three stacked bases.
